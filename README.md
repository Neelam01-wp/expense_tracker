## Expense Tracker

This is a simple expense tracker built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to record your expenses, view a summary, and delete entries.

### Files:

* **index.html:**  The main HTML structure of the application.
* **styles.css:** The CSS stylesheet for the application's appearance.
* **script.js:** The JavaScript code for the application's logic and functionality.

### Features:

**HTML:**

* **Form:** An HTML form for entering expense details (description, amount, and category).
* **Table:** A table to display the list of recorded expenses.
* **Summary:** A section to display the total expenses and the average expense per day.

**CSS:**

* **Styling:**  CSS styles are applied to the form, table, and other elements to provide a visually appealing user interface.
* **Responsiveness:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a better user experience across devices.

**JavaScript:**

* **Form Submission:** JavaScript handles form submission, validating the input and adding new expense entries to the table.
* **Table Update:** JavaScript dynamically updates the table with new expenses and recalculates the summary data.
* **Deletion:**  JavaScript allows users to delete individual expense entries from the table.
* **Data Persistence:**  Uses local storage to save the expense data between sessions, so you don't lose your entries when you close the browser.

### Functionality:

1. **Add Expenses:**  Enter the description, amount, and category of your expense in the form and click the "Add Expense" button.
2. **View Expenses:** The added expenses are displayed in a table with columns for description, amount, category, and a delete button.
3. **Summary:** The total expenses and the average expense per day are displayed in the summary section.
4. **Delete Expenses:** Click the "Delete" button next to an expense to remove it from the list.

### To Use:

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Start adding your expenses and view the summary.
3. Close the browser window. The expenses will be saved in local storage and will be available when you open the page again.
